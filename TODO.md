# TODO

Remaining roadmap, in rough priority order. Rationale for most items lives in
`docs/memgraph-handoff.md` §7.

## Review feedback round (2026-06-11) — being addressed in order

- [x] 1. Traversal chattiness: BFS now hands its whole frontier to
      `-get-facts-for` — one query per direction per level, regardless of
      frontier width.
- [x] 2. Maintenance paths now read candidate sets, not the graph:
      `-select-facts` (whitelisted structural criteria, over-inclusion
      allowed) feeds `conflicts`/`decay`/`stale-facts`/consolidation;
      `-predicate-usage` aggregates store-side. Policy stayed pure and
      unmoved — logic just receives fewer facts.
- [x] 3. Conflict detection widened by candidate generation, two-tier:
      registry exclusion groups (`:stance`, `:revision`) catch cross-predicate
      stance collisions deterministically at write time (loose object
      matching, flag-by-epistemic-composition); `judge --sweep` generates
      what writes can't see — exclusive-value pairs and decision-vs-anything
      shared-object pairs — pure and per-subject bounded, judged offline,
      linked into the same pipeline. The LLM never runs on the write path.
- [x] 4. Ingestion identity discipline, both holes: ambiguous resolution
      (≥2 normalized matches) now surfaces with candidates instead of
      minting a third entity — writes throw, reads say "did you mean", and
      ingest routes such facts to the error bucket. The extraction prompt
      carries a bounded known-entity roster (top by usage, with aliases) as
      a prior, so the LLM reuses exact names instead of coining synonyms.
- [x] 5. Valid time first-class on writes (Level 1): supersede closes the
      predecessor at the successor's valid-from (abutting intervals — as-of
      between two versions returns exactly one); `--valid-until` records a
      closed past interval in one assertion; `invalidate --at` says when a
      fact stopped being true. Inverted intervals are rejected; backdated
      overlaps flag into the conflict pipeline instead of inverting. Level 2
      (transaction-time retraction history, the XTDB model) deliberately out
      of scope — `recorded-at`/`recorded-ms` stay the append-only hook if
      ever needed.
- [ ] 6. Decay is age-based only: reads bump nothing, so a hot fact decays
      like a dead one. Original intent was confidence decay on
      *un-referenced* facts.

## Next up

- [ ] **Failure ingester.** When agent work is rejected or reverted, extract
      why — this is where procedural memory grows from.
- [ ] **Decision-record (ADR) ingester.** Highest-authority source; parse ADR
      files into `supersedes` / `decided-against` / `has-status` commitments.
- [ ] **Predicate promotion command.** `x/*` → `core/*`: register the stable
      twin, rewrite facts, deprecate the staging term with `:replaced-by`
      (never delete). Usage counts already exist (`predicates --usage`).
- [ ] **`load` command.** Restore a store from `dump` JSONL — completes the
      portability loop (dump is currently one-way).
- [ ] **MCP front-end.** Thin second front-end over `memgraph.core` when
      cold-start per query hurts or per-turn call counts grow.
- [ ] **Vector/semantic search.** Datalevin has SIMD vector search; defer
      until FTS + graph retrieval proves insufficient.
- [ ] **ACL tier.** `read-acl`/`write-acl` are carried in the schema but
      unenforced; activate when multi-user.
- [ ] **Multi-language code ingesters.** `ingest-code` is Clojure-only
      (edamame ns-form parsing); tree-sitter would generalize it.
- [ ] **Codebase-memory benchmark.** No LongMemEval/LoCoMo equivalent exists
      for codebase memory — both a validation obstacle and an opportunity.

## Decided against

- **dump-to-SQLite migration path** (2026-06-10). JSONL dump suffices for
  portability; a SQLite backend remains possible behind the `Store` protocol
  if ever actually needed.

## Done

- [x] v0: schema, Store protocol, two backends, conflict machinery, predicate
      registry, bi-temporal reads, BFS, FTS, episodes, JSONL ingest, Clojure
      code ingester, decay, dump, CLI, skill.
- [x] Functional-core/imperative-shell refactor: pure decision logic in
      `memgraph.logic`, effects concentrated in `memgraph.core` + store impls.
- [x] Session-log extractor (`session-extract`): pluggable LLM extractor over
      transcripts (plain text or Claude Code session JSONL), dry-run mode,
      confidence capped at 0.7, source-type `:session-log`.
- [x] Mechanical invalidation on git events: every `ingest-code` pass
      reconciles the store against the new analysis and invalidates
      code-sourced facts it no longer produces (deleted files, removed
      requires, dropped namespaces). Non-lossy; history retains them.
- [x] LLM judge on the semantic-conflict path (`conflicts` + `judge`):
      classifies open conflict pairs as contradicts / duplicate / supersedes /
      compatible. Report-only by default; `--resolve` acts above a confidence
      gate and never auto-resolves contradictions. Shared LLM machinery in
      `memgraph.llm` (`$MEMGRAPH_LLM_CMD`).
- [x] Consolidation (`consolidate`): one offline pass that LLM-summarizes and
      closes open episodes (with a mechanical fallback; summaries become
      full-text searchable), judges open conflicts, decays stale confidence,
      and reports `x/*` promotion candidates. Pattern promotion to procedural
      memory remains future work alongside the promotion command.
- [x] Entity resolution: layered lookup (exact → alias → unique normalized
      match, type-guarded; ambiguity never guesses), write-path self-healing
      aliases, and curation verbs — `entity rename` / `alias` / `merge`
      (repoint + collapse duplicates) / `split` (derived-from lineage) /
      `duplicates` (cluster report).
