  "dump -> JSON -> load round-trip. The fixture store exercises every
  semantic feature the dump carries: a commitment, a supersession chain with
  its invalidation reason, an open conflict with links, aliases, an x/*
  coinage, a closed episode with a summary, and effective-dated valid time.
  The comparison is semantic: entity ids are re-minted by design, so facts
  are compared with subjects/objects projected to names."
