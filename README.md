# claimgraph

A bi-temporal, epistemically-typed knowledge graph for AI coding-agent memory.
Owned, portable, inspectable — a structured replacement for the
`CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` markdown pile.

Every fact is a reified edge carrying a metadata bundle: valid time +
transaction time, confidence, epistemic class (observation / commitment /
preference), source type, scope, and provenance (episode). Nothing is ever
hard-deleted: contradictions close a validity interval, so the graph answers
both *"what do we currently believe about X"* and *"what did we believe in
March, and why did it change."*

```

## Setup

Onboarding is designed to be delegated. Tell your coding agent:

> Set up claimgraph as this project's memory system: clone
> https://github.com/kirahowe/claimgraph somewhere stable (e.g. `~/tools`),
> run its `scripts/setup.sh`, then run `claim setup` in this project and
> follow the "next" steps it prints.

**Prerequisites.** claimgraph runs on two native binaries — babashka (`bb`)
and the Datalevin pod (`dtlv`), no JVM — and `scripts/setup.sh` installs
both, so the prompt above is genuinely the whole setup. They are hard
requirements: `claim` refuses to run without `bb`, and `claim setup` checks
for `dtlv` before wiring anything (a SessionEnd hook without its pod binary
would just be session-end noise, so a failed preflight blocks with the fix
attached). The LLM tiers additionally want an authenticated `claude` CLI
(or any command via `$CLAIMGRAPH_LLM_CMD`) — that one is optional: without
it, extraction and judging sit out while every deterministic layer works.

Or by hand — the same two binaries, then one command in your project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kirahowe/claimgraph ~/tools/claimgraph
~/tools/claimgraph/scripts/setup.sh   # babashka (bb) + the Datalevin pod (dtlv)
                                      # + a global `claim` launcher
                                      # (INSTALL_DIR=~/.local/bin to avoid sudo)
cd ~/your-project
claim setup                           # the whole onboarding, one idempotent command
```

`claim setup` creates and seeds the store (`./.claimgraph/db`), gitignores
the live store (the committable artifacts are `claim dump` output and
`.claimgraph/config.json`), installs the agent skill into
`.claude/skills/claimgraph/` (the judgment layer: when to consult, when to
record, how to phrase facts), and wires the ambient loop — a SessionEnd hook
so every session ends by feeding the graph and the next one starts with its
compiled view injected. Every step reports as JSON, re-running is always
safe, `--dry-run` shows the plan without writing, and `--mcp` additionally
registers the MCP front-end in `.mcp.json`. Any non-default location you
pass (`--db`, `--notes-dir`, `--settings-file`, ...) is persisted to
`.claimgraph/config.json` so later commands need no flags — see
[Configuration](#configuration).

## Quickstart

```bash
# Mechanical code-analysis pass — no LLM, high confidence, idempotent.
# This alone replaces most of what people stuff into CLAUDE.md.
bin/claim ingest-code --dir src

# Record a human decision (a commitment — it will never be silently clobbered)
bin/claim assert --subject api-layer --predicate decided-against \
  --object GraphQL --class commitment --source-type decision-record

# Record a preference
bin/claim assert --subject AuthService --predicate prefers \
  --object "Result types over exceptions" --class preference

# Valid time is first-class on both ends: record history as it happened
bin/claim assert --subject svc --predicate deployed-via --object Heroku \
  --object-kind literal --valid-from 2026-01-01 --valid-until 2026-03-01

# Query
bin/claim facts --entity AuthService --pretty
bin/claim facts --entity claimgraph.store --direction in     # who depends on it?
bin/claim neighbor --entity AuthService --depth 2          # BFS expansion
bin/claim search "GraphQL"                                 # full-text
bin/claim facts --entity AuthService --as-of 2026-03-01    # time travel
bin/claim history --subject AuthService --predicate depends-on
```

All commands emit JSON to stdout (`--pretty` for humans); errors are JSON on
stderr with exit 1. Run `bin/claim help` for the full verb list.

## Configuration

No file location is assumed. Every setting resolves through one precedence
chain — **CLI flag > environment variable > `.claimgraph/config.json` >
default** — and `claim config` prints each setting's resolved value, which
layer set it, and the fully resolved paths.

| Setting | Flag | Env var | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| store path | `--db` | `CLAIMGRAPH_DB` | `./.claimgraph/db` |
| harness | `--harness` | `CLAIMGRAPH_HARNESS` | `claude-code` |
| auto-memory notes dir | `--dir` | `CLAIMGRAPH_NOTES_DIR` | per harness, honoring `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` / `$CODEX_HOME` |
| inject file (write-back target) | `--inject-file` | `CLAIMGRAPH_INJECT_FILE` | per harness: `MEMORY.md` / `memory_summary.md` |
| hook-settings file | `--settings-file` | `CLAIMGRAPH_SETTINGS_FILE` | `<project>/.claude/settings.json` |
| skills dir (`setup`) | `--skills-dir` | `CLAIMGRAPH_SKILLS_DIR` | `<project>/.claude/skills` |
| LLM command | `--extractor` / `--command` | `CLAIMGRAPH_LLM_CMD` | `claude -p` |
| raw-evidence dir | `--evidence-dir` | `CLAIMGRAPH_EVIDENCE_DIR` | `<db>.evidence` |
| consolidation cadence (days) | `--consolidate-days` | `CLAIMGRAPH_CONSOLIDATE_DAYS` | `7` |

The config file is JSON keyed by the kebab-case setting names
(`{"harness": "codex", "notes-dir": "/mnt/notes"}`), lives at
`$CLAIMGRAPH_CONFIG` or `./.claimgraph/config.json`, and is **committable**
— `claim setup` writes the non-default choices you pass it, so one person's
choices hold for every writer of the repo. Two more env vars sit below the
settings layer: `$CLAIMGRAPH_DTLV` (path to the pod binary, default from
`$PATH`) and `$CLAIMGRAPH_WRITER` (this machine's oplog writer id).

## How conflicts resolve

When a new fact contradicts a currently-valid fact with the same
(subject, predicate) on a single-valued predicate, the resolution defaults
from the epistemic class:

- **observation / preference → supersede.** The predecessor's interval closes
  at the successor's `--valid-from` (non-lossy — it stays in history), so the
  new truth begins exactly where the old one ends and `--as-of` between two
  versions returns exactly one. A successor backdated to start *before* its
  predecessor is a valid-time contradiction, not a handoff — it flags as
  `backdated-overlap` instead of inverting an interval.
- **commitment → flag.** Both facts stay valid, the conflict is linked and the
  `candidates` are returned. A human decision is never silently overwritten by
  new evidence — it surfaces for review.
- Caller override: `--on-conflict supersede|flag|ignore`.
- Multi-valued predicates (e.g. `depends-on`) accumulate. Exact duplicates
  **reinforce**: the world (or the user) just confirmed the fact, so its
  disuse clock resets and its confidence may rise toward a per-source ceiling
  — never above it, never down, and never by repetition alone.
- **Exclusion groups** widen detection across predicates: registry rows can
  declare mutually-exclusive stances toward the same object (`prefers` /
  `decided-against` share the `:stance` group; `supersedes`/`superseded-by`
  the `:revision` group), matched loosely across the entity/literal divide —
  `decided-against "GraphQL"` collides with `prefers GraphQL`. Stance
  collisions always involve a commitment, so they flag by composition.
  Groups are deliberately conservative: a false conflict nags the human, so
  only clearly-opposed pairs are declared; everything fuzzier goes to the
  sweep.

Flagged conflicts stay open until resolved. `claim conflicts` lists them;
`claim judge` runs an LLM over each pair and classifies the relation —
`contradicts`, `duplicate`, `supersedes`, or `compatible`. By default it only
reports; with `--resolve` it invalidates duplicates and superseded facts and
unlinks compatible pairs, gated by `--min-confidence` (0.8). A `contradicts`
verdict is never auto-resolved — genuine contradictions always go to the
human. The judge command is pluggable like the extractor (`--command` /
`$CLAIMGRAPH_LLM_CMD`, default `claude -p`).

`claim judge --sweep` generates the candidates the write path can't see —
multiple values of a `:value-exclusivity :exclusive` predicate (two `prefers`
on one subject tend to be alternatives, not accumulation), and same-subject
facts sharing an object across predicates where one side is a decision
(`depends-on X` while `decided-against X` stands). Generation is pure and
bounded per-subject, never O(graph²); the LLM never runs on the write path.
Verdicts feed the same pipeline: compatible pairs are dropped silently,
genuine hits are linked, contradictions wait for the human. `consolidate`
runs the sweep as a stage.

## The vocabulary

23 curated `core/*` predicates across four categories (structural, procedural,
decision, provenance), each a first-class queryable row in the same store with
object-kind, cardinality, default epistemic class, and a `maps-to` anchor to an
established standard (PROV-O / SPDX / DOAP / Dublin Core).

Unknown predicates throw with a `did-you-mean` fuzzy suggestion — the cheap
defense against LLM-driven predicate proliferation. New relations are coined
in the `x/*` staging namespace (auto-registered with `:testing` status) and
promoted once proven. `bin/claim predicates --usage` shows what's earning
its place.

## Architecture

Functional core, imperative shell. All decision logic — conflict resolution,
epistemic/object-kind rules, bi-temporal filters, BFS folds, decay plans — is
pure functions over plain values in `claimgraph.logic` (time and fresh ids are
passed in; decisions come back as effect plans). `claimgraph.core` is the thin
shell that gathers store reads, asks logic for a decision, and executes the
plan. Mutation is concentrated there and in the store implementations.

```

- **Storage**: [Datalevin](https://github.com/datalevin/datalevin) via Babashka
  pod — the `dtlv` binary is a GraalVM native image that speaks the pod
  protocol, so the whole stack is two fast-start native binaries. The pod is
  loaded from `$PATH` (override with `$CLAIMGRAPH_DTLV`) at a pinned release.
  The storage abstraction keeps other engines pluggable; the test suite runs
  identically against the in-memory implementation, which is the proof of it.
- **Bi-temporality is modeled, not engine-native**: explicit `t-valid` /
  `t-invalid` / `recorded-at` attributes, identical in shape across backends.
  Valid time is settable on both ends of every write; transaction time
  (`recorded-at`) is append-only. Full XTDB-style correction history
  (auditing how a belief about the past evolved) is deliberately out of
  scope.
- **Objects are entities or literals** (RDF-style): traversal only follows
  entity-kind objects; preferences live as literal facts without minting junk
  nodes. Enforced at write time per the predicate registry.
- **Inverses are computed at query time** (`--direction in|both`), not stored
  as twins — nothing to keep consistent on invalidation.
- **`has-status` is a predicate**, so ADR status history accumulates
  bi-temporally and status changes flow through the conflict machinery.
- **Entity resolution is layered**: lookups resolve exact names, then aliases,
  then a unique case/separator-insensitive match (type-guarded, so a namespace
  can't silently match a class). A detected collision (two or more normalized
  matches) never guesses AND never creates — it errors with the candidates
  attached, and ingestion routes such facts to the error bucket instead of
  minting a third entity. Write-path near-matches self-heal by recording the
  queried name as an alias. Curation
  verbs handle the rest: `entity rename` keeps the old name as an alias with
  facts and history intact, `entity merge` repoints facts and collapses the
  exposed duplicates non-lossily, `entity split` records `derived-from`
  lineage, and `entity duplicates` reports likely-duplicate clusters.

## Ingestion tiers

1. **`ingest-code`** — mechanical Clojure analysis (edamame ns-form parsing, no
   LLM): `defined-in`, `depends-on`, `written-in` facts at 0.95 confidence
   under a `:code` episode ref'd to the git SHA. Each pass reconciles the
   store against the code: facts the analysis no longer produces (deleted
   files, removed requires, dropped namespaces) are invalidated mechanically,
   unchanged facts no-op, and a namespace that moves files supersedes its old
   location. The graph tracks the code with no LLM in the loop.
2. **`session-extract`** — LLM extraction of durable knowledge (preferences,
   decisions, gotchas, conventions) from a session transcript — plain text or
   Claude Code session JSONL. The extractor is pluggable: defaults to an
   already-authenticated `claude -p` (subscription-as-judge, ~$0 marginal),
   overridable via `--extractor` / `$CLAIMGRAPH_LLM_CMD`. The prompt carries a
   bounded roster of known entities (top by fact count, with aliases) as a
   prior — "use these exact names when you mean them" — so the extractor
   aligns synonyms instead of coining `AuthSvc` next to `AuthService`;
   normalization catches typographic drift, the roster catches semantic
   drift, and ambiguity detection backstops both. Session-derived
   facts are second-class evidence by design: confidence capped at 0.7,
   source-type `session-log`. `--dry-run` shows what would be ingested.
3. **`ingest-notes`** — the ambient tier (`docs/consuming-auto-memory.md`):
   consumes the harness's auto-memory notes (Claude Code's
   `~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/`; `--harness codex` for Codex's
   `~/.codex/memories/`, making claimgraph the cross-harness consolidator —
   notes from both harnesses about the same project merge into one graph,
   entity resolution aligns their vocabularies, and restatement across
   harnesses reinforces) as an extraction substrate —
   already LLM-distilled, delta-detected per file so only changed notes reach
   the extractor, one episode per (file, revision) so provenance answers
   "which note file, at which state, said this." Notes flatten who-said-what,
   so everything ingests as agent inference: source-type `agent-note`,
   confidence capped at 0.65, and never a commitment — a decision reported by
   a note is demoted to an observation; genuine decisions arrive via `assert`.
   No reconciliation: the harness compacts notes under space pressure, and
   absence-by-compaction isn't falsity — un-restated facts just fade by
   disuse. The marker-delimited managed section claimgraph writes into
   `MEMORY.md` is stripped before hashing and extraction (the echo-loop
   guard), so the graph never re-consumes its own compiled view.
4. **`ingest`** — batch JSONL (file or stdin) under one episode. Each line
   goes through the full conflict machinery; `class` is accepted as an alias
   for the epistemic field.
5. **`assert`** — one fact, interactively or from a skill.

## Raw evidence

Extraction decides what to keep before knowing what a future query will
hinge on (the write-before-query barrier), so `session-extract` and
`ingest-notes` also keep their raw input: immutable, content-addressed
artifacts in `<db>.evidence/`, pointed to by the episode they were extracted
under. `bin/claim evidence --episode ID` returns the exact bytes —
provenance past the summary, and nothing an extractor drops is
unrecoverable. Notes-as-primary, transcripts-as-fallback: the artifacts are
a local audit trail and don't ride the dump; the pointer does.

## Forgetting

Disuse decay is a view, not a job. Facts store a base confidence and a
`last-reinforced-at` anchor; reads compute *effective* confidence — the base
halved per 90-day half-life since last reinforcement (floor 0.05) — and
return both. `--min-confidence` filters on the effective value, search ranks
fact hits by it, and `--as-of` queries see period-appropriate decay.
Commitments and decision-record facts never fade.

Reinforcement is what counts as "use": re-asserting an existing fact (a
session restates it, the code ingester re-derives it) resets its clock and
raises its base toward a per-source ceiling (`decision-record` 1.0, `code`
0.95, `user-assertion` 0.9, `session-log` 0.7, `inferred` 0.6) — so a fact
re-derived 500 times stays distinguishable from a human decision. The
ingester synergy does most of the work: every code pass reinforces what the
code still says, reconciliation invalidates what it stopped saying, and
decay is left fading the session-derived facts nobody restates. Maintenance
scans never reinforce — only intent writes do.

## Maintenance

- `hooks install` / `hooks run` — the ambient loop, automated: a Claude Code
  SessionEnd hook (wired by `hooks install` into the project's hook settings
  — default `.claude/settings.json`, overridable via `--settings-file`)
  runs `ingest-notes` → `compile-context` → `consolidate`-when-due (stamp-
  gated, default weekly) at the end of every session. Stages report
  independently — an extractor failure never blocks the deterministic
  recompile. Capture in, injection out, zero behavior change required.
- `compile-context` — the write-back half of the ambient loop
  (`docs/consuming-auto-memory.md`): compiles the graph's current view into a
  marker-delimited managed section at the head of the file the harness
  auto-injects (Claude Code: `MEMORY.md`), so every session starts with it for
  free. Deterministic (no LLM), budgeted (25 KB default — the injection
  window), idempotent. Priority order: standing decisions (never relitigate),
  open conflicts, recent supersessions ("Heroku → Fly on 2026-06-02" — the
  what-changed briefing), top current facts by effective confidence, with
  code-derived facts excluded — the injected view carries only what the code
  can't say. `ingest-notes` strips the managed section before hashing, so
  compile → ingest → compile is a fixed point: the graph never re-consumes
  its own view.
- `consolidate` — the Dreaming-style offline pass: LLM-summarizes and closes
  open episodes (summaries are full-text indexed, so episodic history becomes
  searchable — "why did we do X" is a query), judges open conflicts, sweeps
  for conflict candidates the write path can't see, and reports `x/*`
  predicates earning promotion review. Falls back to a mechanical digest when
  the LLM is unavailable, so the pass always makes progress.
- `judge` — LLM review of open conflicts on its own (see "How conflicts
  resolve").
- **Multi-writer works the local-first way.** Every mutation appends an
  effect line to this writer's own append-only log in
  `<db>.oplog/<writer>.jsonl`, stamped with a hybrid logical clock. The live
  store is a materialized view; the logs are the record. Each machine only
  appends to its own file, so any file syncer (git, rsync, Syncthing) can
  move logs between machines and a merge conflict cannot occur in transport.
  `claim reconcile` applies unseen foreign effects in canonical clock
  order, matches entity identity by name (each machine keeps its own display
  name and picks up the other's as an alias), collapses claims both writers
  made independently (closed, not erased), and queues contradictions neither
  writer could see for the judge. This is deliberately not a CRDT: when two
  machines disagree, the job is to show a human the disagreement, and open
  conflicts are already how claimgraph does that.
- On one machine, concurrent writers serialize through a **lease**
  (`<db>.lock`: atomic, token-guarded, 30s TTL, so a crashed writer expires
  instead of wedging the store). Reads never take it.
- `dump` / `load` — the portability story, two-way: `dump` exports everything
  as JSONL (the live LMDB directory is gitignored; the dump is the committable
  artifact), `load` restores a fresh store from it — fact/episode ids,
  validity intervals, invalidation reasons, and conflict links round-trip
  exactly (a raw restore; the conflict machinery does not re-run). Multi-
  machine users of the ambient loop converge through the committed dump.

## MCP front-end

`bin/claim mcp` serves the graph over MCP stdio — the store (and the
Datalevin pod) opens once per session instead of paying ~350ms of cold start
per CLI call, which the ambient loop's per-prompt coach hook made worth
fixing. Tools: `memory_facts`, `memory_search`, `memory_recall`,
`memory_history`, `memory_conflicts`, `memory_coach`, and `memory_assert`
(write-lease-guarded, full conflict machinery). Wire up: `claim setup --mcp`
(writes the project's `.mcp.json`) or `claude mcp add claimgraph -- claim mcp`.
The CLI and the skill remain the primary surface; MCP is the low-latency
second front-end the handoff doc trigger-gated.

## Benchmark

No LongMemEval/LoCoMo equivalent exists for codebase memory, so `bench/` is
the seed of one: a synthetic project (shoply) that lives through three
sessions and three code passes from January to now — decisions made and
relitigated, a namespace renamed and merged, a hosting migration, a
dependency taken up against a standing rejection, an observation nobody ever
restates. Two layers, split by determinism:

```bash
bb bench       # mechanics: recorded LLM outputs, real store and ingesters,
               # 33 questions across retrieval / time-travel / history /
               # identity / conflicts / forgetting / provenance / ambient
               # (the notes loop: restatement reinforces, planted decisions
               # demote and flag, compaction ≠ falsity, echo guard holds) /
               # staleness (the code contradicts session facts and standing
               # decisions without anyone saying so) / abstention (refusal vs
               # confabulation when the graph does not know) / poisoning (MINJA-
               # style planted content: caps, decay differential, flag-not-
               # override, quarantinable provenance) / shift-recovery (Recovery@0
               # after the rename, the dropped dep, and the migration) /
               # contamination (a swapped name — React, the in-house clojure
               # queueing library — must answer from the graph). Reports
               # per-read latency and the real CLI cold-start next to accuracy.
               # Deterministic; non-zero exit below a perfect score, and it
               # runs in the test suite as a longitudinal regression gate.
bb bench llm   # quality: the same graph, a real model ($CLAIMGRAPH_LLM_CMD).
               # `bb bench llm 5` judges each labeled conflict pair 5 times
               # (default 3): accuracy-of-majority with per-pair flip rate —
               # a pair that flips is a pair --resolve must not act on.
               # Measures extraction precision/recall against annotated
               # transcripts, judge verdict accuracy on labeled conflict
               # pairs, and entity fragmentation (suspect names that
               # normalization can't rescue). Informational; never in CI.
```

`CLAIMGRAPH_BENCH_STORE=memory` runs mechanics pod-free. Fixture, questions,
and ground truth live in `bench/`; the harness drives the same core API the
CLI uses, so an MCP front-end won't invalidate it.

## Tests

```bash
bb test    # 119 tests / 757 assertions
```

The core-semantics suite runs against BOTH store implementations (the proof of
the storage abstraction); the logic suite tests pure decision functions with no
store at all; the session suite injects a fake extractor and never shells out.
`CLAIMGRAPH_TEST_SKIP_DATALEVIN=1 bb test` runs pod-free.

## The book

`book/` holds a full-length book about the project: background and mental
model as prose, and every code-bearing chapter as a real Clojure namespace
that Clay evaluates against this source tree at build time, rendered into a
Quarto book. Build it with `bb book` (needs a JVM and the
[quarto](https://quarto.org) CLI; the tool itself needs neither), or
`bb book:preview` to serve it locally. Output lands in
`book/rendered/_book/`.
