  "compile-context: the write-back half of the ambient loop
  (docs/consuming-auto-memory.md §3). Compiles a deterministic, budgeted
  'what's currently true' view into the marker-delimited managed section of
  the file the harness auto-injects (Claude Code: the head of MEMORY.md) —
  the graph's answer to ambient injection without building injection.

  Deterministic by construction: no LLM anywhere, same graph + same clock =
  byte-identical output. Priority order under the byte budget: standing
  commitments (the do-not-relitigate list), open conflicts awaiting the
  human, recent supersessions (the 'what changed since you last looked'
  briefing nothing else in the field provides), then top currently-valid
  facts by decay-aware effective confidence. Code-derived facts are excluded
  from the fact list: they are regenerable and obvious from the code itself,
  and the AGENTS.md result says ambient context must carry only what the
  code cannot say.

  The echo-loop guard is structural: ingest-notes strips the managed section
  before hashing and extraction, so compile → ingest → compile is a fixed
  point — the graph never re-consumes its own compiled view."
