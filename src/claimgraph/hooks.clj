(ns claimgraph.hooks
  "The ambient loop's automation (docs/consuming-auto-memory.md §4): one verb
  a Claude Code SessionEnd hook can call, and an installer that wires it into
  the project's hook configuration.

  `hooks run` = ingest-notes → compile-context → consolidate-if-due. Each
  stage is attempted independently: an extractor failure (no `claude` on
  PATH, not authenticated) must never stop the deterministic compile — the
  next session still deserves the freshest view the graph can produce.
  Consolidation runs at lower frequency, gated by a sibling stamp file next
  to the db (default: at most every 7 days).

  `hooks install` merges a SessionEnd entry into the project's hook settings
  (default <project>/.claude/settings.json; overridable via --settings-file /
  $CLAIMGRAPH_SETTINGS_FILE / the project config), idempotently: re-running
  updates the claimgraph entry in place and never duplicates it; everything
  else in the file is preserved."
