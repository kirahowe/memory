(def help-text "claimgraph — bi-temporal, epistemically-typed knowledge graph for coding-agent memory

Usage: claim <command> [options]

All commands accept --db PATH and --pretty. All output is JSON on stdout;
errors are JSON on stderr with exit code 1.

Nothing about file locations is assumed. Every setting resolves through one
precedence chain — CLI flag > environment variable > .claimgraph/config.json
> default — and `claim config` shows each one's value and where it came from.
Harness defaults honor the harness's own relocations ($CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR,
$CODEX_HOME).

Commands:
  setup               One-shot onboarding for a project (idempotent, safe to
                        re-run): create + seed the store, persist non-default
                        choices to .claimgraph/config.json, gitignore the live
                        store, install the agent skill, wire the ambient loop
                        (hooks install). [--project DIR] [--db PATH]

                        [--bin claim] [--dry-run]
  config              Show every setting: resolved value, which layer set it
                        (flag/env/config-file/default), and the fully resolved
                        paths (db, notes dir, inject file, settings file, ...)
  init                Create the store and seed the predicate vocabulary

                        record when a fact was true (a closed past interval is
                        one assertion). Superseding closes the predecessor at
                        the successor's valid-from; a successor starting
                        at-or-before its predecessor flags as backdated-overlap
                        instead of inverting an interval.
  facts               Facts about an entity: --entity E [--predicate P] [--scope S]
                        [--as-of ISO] [--direction out|in|both] [--include-invalidated]
                        [--min-confidence 0.5]
                        Results carry effective-confidence: the stored base
                        halved per 90-day half-life since last reinforcement
                        (re-assertion resets the clock; commitments and

                        filters on the effective value.
  neighbor            BFS neighborhood: --entity E [--depth 2] [--as-of ISO] [--min-confidence 0.5]
                        With --query \"...\" the fixed-depth BFS becomes an
                        evidence-guided walk: each round expands only the
                        [--beam 8] best edges by query-overlap × effective
                        confidence, until [--budget 25] facts.
  coach               Gated push: claim coach \"task text\" — decides
                        WHETHER the graph holds something worth interrupting
                        with (standing decisions, known failure modes, open
                        conflicts touching the task); silent otherwise.
                        --hook reads Claude Code hook JSON on stdin and
                        emits additionalContext only when the gate fires
                        (wired by hooks install --coach).
  recall              Sufficiency escalation: claim recall \"query\"
                        [--min-hits 1]. Answers from the cheapest tier that
                        can support the query — graph facts (hybrid search),
                        then episode summaries, then raw evidence pages;
                        the result says which tier answered.
  history             All versions of (subject, predicate): --subject S --predicate P
  search              Full-text search: claim search \"redis migration\"
  invalidate          Close a fact's validity interval: --fact-id F [--reason R]
                        [--at ISO] (when it stopped being true; default now)

  judge               LLM-judge open conflicts: relation contradicts|duplicate|
                        supersedes|compatible per pair. Reports only, unless
                        --resolve, which acts on verdicts at/above
                        --min-confidence (0.8): invalidates duplicates and

                        contradicts verdict is never auto-resolved.
                        [--command \"claude -p\"] (default $CLAIMGRAPH_LLM_CMD)
                        --sweep generates candidates the write path can't
                        see (exclusive-value pairs, decision-category facts
                        sharing an object across predicates), judges them,
                        and links genuine hits into the same pipeline.
  entity ensure       --name N [--type T] [--scope S]
  entity list         [--type T] [--scope S]
  entity rename       --from X --to Y [--scope S]  (old name kept as alias;
                        facts and history untouched)
  entity alias        --name X --alias Y [--scope S]
  entity merge        --from X --into Y [--scope S]  (repoints facts, carries
                        names as aliases, invalidates exposed duplicates)
  entity split        --from X --into \"A,B\" [--scope S]  (records derived-from
                        lineage; facts stay on the source for review)
  entity duplicates   Report likely-duplicate entity clusters

  Entity lookups everywhere resolve exact names, then aliases, then a unique
  case/separator-insensitive match (\"auth-service\" finds \"AuthService\");
  near-match resolutions self-heal by recording the queried name as an alias.
  predicates          List the vocabulary [--category C] [--status S] [--usage]
  predicate register  Coin an :x/* predicate: --id x/uses-pattern [--definition ...]
  predicate promote   Graduate a staging term: --from x/uses-pattern
                        --to core/uses-pattern [--definition ...] [--label ...]
                        [--category ...] [--object-kind ...] [--cardinality ...]
                        [--maps-to ...]. Registers the stable twin, rewrites
                        every fact onto it (term rename, history untouched),
                        deprecates the x/* id with a replaced-by pointer —
                        further writes to it fail with the forwarding address.
  evidence            The raw bytes an episode was extracted from:
                        --episode ID | --hash SHA256 [--evidence-dir DIR]
                        Provenance past the summary: session-extract and
                        ingest-notes keep their raw input as immutable
                        content-addressed artifacts in <db>.evidence/ —
                        what the extractor dropped is never unrecoverable.

                        Default extractor: $CLAIMGRAPH_LLM_CMD or \"claude -p\".
                        Extracted facts are capped at 0.7 confidence, source-type
                        session-log. Use --dry-run to review before ingesting.
  ingest-notes        Ingest the harness's auto-memory notes (the ambient
                        capture tier): delta-detects changed note files and
                        extracts only those, one episode per (file, revision).

                        [--dry-run] [--extractor \"claude -p\"]
                        The notes dir defaults per harness (honoring
                        $CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR / $CODEX_HOME); override with
                        --dir, $CLAIMGRAPH_NOTES_DIR, or notes-dir in the
                        project config.
                        Notes ingest as agent inference: source-type agent-note,
                        confidence capped at 0.65, never commitments (a decision
                        reported by a note is demoted to an observation). No
                        reconciliation: notes the harness compacts away fade by
                        disuse instead of being invalidated. The managed
                        claimgraph section of MEMORY.md is never re-consumed.
  ingest-adr          Mechanically parse decision records (no LLM): --dir D |
                        --file F [--dry-run]; default dirs docs/adr,
                        docs/decisions, adr. Title/filename -> the ADR
                        entity; Status: -> has-status (a change supersedes,
                        history accumulates); Supersedes:/Superseded by: ->
                        revision edges; considered-options-minus-chosen and
                        Rejected: -> decided-against commitments. All at
                        decision-record authority (1.0).
  ingest-failure      Extract lessons from rejected/reverted/failed work
                        (review text, revert message, error transcript):
                        --file F | stdin [--context \"what was attempted\"]
                        [--ref ID] [--dry-run] [--extractor CMD]
                        The lesson, not the diff: known hazards land as
                        failure-mode facts, corrective practices as prefers,
                        human rulings as decided-against. Episode source-type
                        failure-report (the valence signal), raw material
                        kept as evidence. Capped at 0.7 like all extraction.
  compile-context     Compile the graph's current view into the managed
                        section of the file the harness auto-injects
                        (Claude Code: the head of MEMORY.md) — the ambient
                        read path. Deterministic (no LLM), budgeted,
                        idempotent; only the marker-delimited block is
                        rewritten, the harness's own notes stay untouched.
                        Sections in priority order: standing decisions,
                        open conflicts, recent supersessions, top current
                        facts by effective confidence (code-derived facts
                        excluded — the view carries what the code can't say).

  hooks install       Wire the ambient loop into the project's hook settings

                        Idempotent; foreign hooks and other settings are
                        preserved. Default target
                        <project>/.claude/settings.json — override with

                        settings-file in the project config.

                        --coach also wires a UserPromptSubmit hook running

                        an extractor failure never blocks the deterministic
                        recompile. [--harness claude-code] [--project DIR]

                        coach) log which facts they surfaced (<db>.retrievals);
                        accepted reinforces everything retrieved since the
                        last outcome mark (disuse clock reset — usefulness is
                        evidence of aliveness, never higher confidence);
                        rejected reinforces nothing and reports the facts
                        that were in play. Wire it to PR merge/close, or run
                        by hand; the rejection's lesson goes to ingest-failure.

                        the conflict machinery does NOT re-run). Refuses a
                        store that already holds data.
  mcp                 Serve the graph over MCP (stdio): the store opens once
                        per session instead of paying the ~350ms bb+pod cold
                        start per call. Tools: memory_facts, memory_search,
                        memory_recall, memory_history, memory_conflicts,
                        memory_coach, memory_assert (lease-guarded).

  reconcile           Merge other writers' effect logs into this store.
                        Every write already appends to your own log in
                        <db>.oplog/<writer>.jsonl; sync that directory
                        between machines however you like (git, rsync,
                        Syncthing) and run reconcile on arrival. Foreign
                        effects apply in canonical clock order with entity
                        identity matched by name; claims both writers made
                        independently collapse non-lossily; contradictions
                        neither writer could see become sweep candidates
                        for the judge. Idempotent.
  stats               Store counts
  consolidate         Offline consolidation pass: LLM-summarize and close open
                        episodes that contain facts (summaries become
                        full-text searchable; mechanical digest if the LLM is
                        unavailable), judge open conflicts (report-only unless
                        --resolve), sweep for conflict candidates the write
                        path can't see, and report x/* predicates earning
                        promotion review.
