(ns claimgraph.setup
  "One-shot onboarding: `claim setup` takes a project from zero to a working
  memory system in one idempotent, dry-runnable command — store initialized
  and seeded, non-default locations persisted to the project config, the live
  store gitignored, the agent skill installed, the ambient loop wired, and
  (opt-in) the MCP server registered. Built so onboarding can be delegated to
  a coding agent: nothing is interactive, every step reports independently as
  JSON (a failed step never blocks the rest), and re-running is always safe.

  No location is assumed: every path flows through claimgraph.config
  (flag > env > .claimgraph/config.json > default), and choices made here are
  written back to the config file so later bare commands honor them."
