(ns memgraph.judge
  "LLM judge for the semantic-conflict path. Mechanical conflict detection
  (in assert-fact) flags; the judge classifies what the flag actually means:

    contradicts — genuinely incompatible; a human must decide
    duplicate   — the newer fact restates the established one
    supersedes  — the newer fact is the legitimate successor
    compatible  — both can hold; not actually in conflict

  Functional core / imperative shell: prompt construction, verdict parsing,
  and the resolution plan are pure; `judge-conflicts!` iterates the store's
  open conflicts through the pluggable LLM (same subscription-as-judge
  mechanism as the session extractor; tests inject :judge-fn).

  By default the judge only enriches — it reports verdicts and acts on
  nothing. With :resolve it executes the plan for verdicts at or above
  :min-confidence, and even then a contradicts verdict is never auto-resolved:
  surfacing those to the human is the point of the flag machinery."
