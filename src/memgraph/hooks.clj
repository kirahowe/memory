(ns memgraph.hooks
  "The ambient loop's automation (docs/consuming-auto-memory.md §4): one verb
  a Claude Code SessionEnd hook can call, and an installer that wires it into
  the project's hook configuration.

  `hooks run` = ingest-notes → compile-context → consolidate-if-due. Each
  stage is attempted independently: an extractor failure (no `claude` on
  PATH, not authenticated) must never stop the deterministic compile — the
  next session still deserves the freshest view the graph can produce.
  Consolidation runs at lower frequency, gated by a sibling stamp file next
  to the db (default: at most every 7 days).

  `hooks install` merges a SessionEnd entry into <project>/.claude/settings.json,
  idempotently: re-running updates the memgraph entry in place and never
  duplicates it; everything else in the file is preserved."
