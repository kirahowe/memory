(ns memgraph.store
  "The storage abstraction: the boundary between storage-agnostic core
  operations and a concrete storage engine. Implementations speak plain
  Clojure maps in the wire shapes documented below; all temporal/conflict/
  validation semantics live in memgraph.core and memgraph.logic, NOT here.
  Store methods are raw primitives.

  Wire shapes:
