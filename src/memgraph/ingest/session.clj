  "Session-log extractor: turn a session transcript into durable facts via a
  pluggable LLM extractor. Functional core / imperative shell: transcript
  normalization, prompt construction, and response parsing/clamping are all
  pure; the only effects are reading the transcript and shelling out to the
  extractor command.

  The default extractor is `claude -p` — an already-authenticated agent CLI
  (subscription-as-judge, ~$0 marginal). Override with --extractor or
  $MEMGRAPH_LLM_CMD; tests inject :extractor-fn and never shell out.

  Session-derived facts are second-class evidence by design: confidence is
  capped at 0.7 and source-type is forced to :session-log."
