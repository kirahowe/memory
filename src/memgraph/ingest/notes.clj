  "Auto-memory notes ingester: the fourth ingestion tier
  (docs/consuming-auto-memory.md). Consumes the harness's own memory notes —
  already LLM-distilled by the model that watched the session — as an
  extraction substrate, delta-detected per file so only changed notes reach
  the extractor.

  Functional core / imperative shell like the session ingester it adapts:
  hashing, delta planning, prompt construction, and clamping are pure; the
  effects are directory reads and the pluggable extractor shell-out.

  Epistemic treatment: notes flatten who-said-what, so everything ingests as
  agent inference — source-type :agent-note, confidence capped below the
  session tier, and NEVER a commitment (a reported decision is demoted to an
  observation; genuine decisions arrive via the direct assert path). No
  reconciliation applies: the harness compacts notes under space pressure,
  and absence-by-compaction is not falsity — facts that stop being restated
  simply stop being reinforced and fade by disuse decay."
