  which file it auto-injects, and the markers delimiting the managed section
  memgraph compiles into that file. Everything here is pure except notes-dir's
  home-directory lookup, passed in by callers where testability matters.

  The managed-section markers are the echo-loop guard's anchor: ingest-notes
  strips the section before hashing and extraction (our compiled view is never
