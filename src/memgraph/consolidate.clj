(ns memgraph.consolidate
  "Dreaming-style offline consolidation: one pass that summarizes and closes
  open episodes (LLM, with a mechanical fallback), judges open conflicts,
  decays stale confidence, and reports :x/* predicates that have earned
  promotion review.

  Functional core / imperative shell: episode planning, prompt construction,
  summary parsing, the mechanical fallback, and promotion-candidate selection
  are pure; `consolidate!` executes the stages. The LLM is pluggable as
  everywhere ($MEMGRAPH_LLM_CMD, default claude -p; tests inject
  :summarize-fn / :judge-fn).

  Closing an episode with a summary is what turns bulky episodic memory into
  something retrievable: summaries are full-text indexed, so \"why did we do
  X\" becomes a search."
