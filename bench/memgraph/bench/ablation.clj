  "The retrieval-vs-structure ablation (review §4.3.7, after the Diagnosing
  study): hold the fixture fixed, compare what each layer can answer —

    :memgraph-full  the real read path (entity resolution, as-of, history,
                    conflicts, decay) — the mechanics questions, restated
    :raw-chunks     the fixture's raw inputs (transcripts, notes, code) as
                    chunks under TF-IDF retrieval, no store at all
    :memgraph-fts   the graph's facts but reachable ONLY through full-text
                    search — structure written, retrieval degraded

  Deterministic by construction, which forces an honest scoring rule for the
  retrieval arms: a question is answered iff the top-k results contain the
  true answer AND no competing stale/false answer. Plain retrieval carries
  no validity model, so surfacing both 'Heroku' and 'Fly.io' for a
  current-truth question is a miss — disambiguation is exactly what the
  structure is for. Where raw chunks DO answer (plain recall), we publish
  that too; the negative half is what makes the positive half credible."
