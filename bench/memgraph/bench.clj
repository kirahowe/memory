  "The codebase-memory benchmark. Two layers, split by determinism:

  bb bench      — mechanics: drive the fixture timeline through the real
                  store and ingesters with RECORDED LLM outputs, then score
                  the question set. Deterministic; exits non-zero below a
                  perfect score, so it doubles as a longitudinal regression
                  gate.
  bb bench llm  — quality: build the same graph, then measure a real model
                  (via $MEMGRAPH_LLM_CMD, default claude -p) on extraction
                  precision/recall, judge verdict accuracy, and entity
                  fragmentation. Informational; never in CI.

  MEMGRAPH_BENCH_STORE=memory runs mechanics pod-free."
