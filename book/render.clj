  "Build the memgraph book: Clay evaluates the chapter namespaces against the
  real source under src/, writes a Quarto book project, and Quarto renders it
  to HTML. Prose chapters are plain markdown; code chapters are Clojure
  namespaces whose forms actually run at build time, so every example in the
  book is checked on every build.

  Run through the bb tasks:
    bb book            render to book/rendered/_book
    bb book:preview    render, then serve with quarto preview

  Needs a JVM and the quarto CLI on PATH (https://quarto.org)."
