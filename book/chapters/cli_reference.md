# CLI reference

Every command accepts `--db PATH` (default `$MEMGRAPH_DB`, then
`./.memgraph/db`) and `--pretty`. Output is JSON on stdout; errors are JSON
on stderr with exit code 1, so everything composes with shell tooling and
the skill alike. `bin/memgraph help` is the authoritative, always-current
version of this list.

## Store and writes

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `init` | Create the store and seed the 23-predicate vocabulary |
| `assert` | One fact through validation and conflict resolution: `--subject --predicate --object`, with `--class`, `--source-type`, `--confidence`, `--scope`, `--valid-from/--valid-until`, `--on-conflict` |
| `invalidate` | Close a fact's validity interval: `--fact-id`, `--reason`, `--at` (when it stopped being true) |
| `ingest` | Batch-assert JSONL (file or stdin) under one episode |

## Reads

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `facts` | Facts about an entity; `--as-of`, `--direction out\|in\|both`, `--predicate`, `--min-confidence` (effective), `--include-invalidated` |
| `history` | Every version of (subject, predicate), valid and invalidated, ordered |
| `search` | Hybrid full-text, entity, and neighborhood retrieval, rank-fused |
| `neighbor` | BFS to `--depth`; with `--query` it becomes the evidence-guided walk (`--beam`, `--budget`) |
| `recall` | Sufficiency escalation: facts, then episode summaries, then raw evidence; reports which tier answered |
| `coach` | Gated push: interrupts only when the graph holds something that bears on the task; `--hook` for Claude Code hook wiring |
| `conflicts` | Open conflicts awaiting a ruling |
| `stats` | Store counts |

## Entities and predicates

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `entity ensure / list / rename / alias / merge / split / duplicates` | Curation: renames keep old names as aliases with history intact; merge repoints and collapses non-lossily; split records lineage |
| `predicates` | List the vocabulary (`--usage` shows what earns its place) |
| `predicate register` | Coin an `x/*` staging predicate |
| `predicate promote` | Graduate `x/*` to `core/*`: register, rewrite facts, deprecate with a forwarding pointer |

## Ingestion tiers

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `ingest-code` | Mechanical Clojure analysis; reconciling, no LLM, 0.95 confidence |
| `session-extract` | LLM extraction from transcripts; capped 0.7, `--dry-run`, pluggable `--extractor` |
| `ingest-notes` | The ambient tier: harness auto-memory, delta-detected, capped 0.65, never commitments |
| `ingest-adr` | Mechanical decision-record parsing at full authority |
| `ingest-failure` | Lessons from rejected work; failure modes, valence, evidence kept |

## Episodes and evidence

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `episode open / close / list` | Provenance anchors; closing attaches the searchable summary |
| `evidence` | The raw bytes an episode was extracted from, by episode or hash |

## Maintenance and automation

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `consolidate` | Offline pass: summarize episodes, judge, sweep, enrichment, promotion review |
| `judge` | Classify open conflicts; `--resolve` acts on high-confidence verdicts, never on contradictions; `--sweep` generates candidates |
| `outcome` | `accepted` reinforces everything retrieved since the last mark; `rejected` reports it |
| `compile-context` | Write the graph's current view into the harness's injection file |
| `hooks install / run` | Wire and run the ambient SessionEnd loop (`--coach` adds the prompt-time gate) |
| `dump` / `load` | JSONL export and exact restore (the committable, portable artifact) |
| `reconcile` | Apply other writers' effect logs; idempotent |
| `mcp` | Serve the graph over MCP stdio |

## Environment

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `MEMGRAPH_DB` | Default store path |
| `MEMGRAPH_DTLV` | Path to the Datalevin pod binary (otherwise `$PATH`) |
| `MEMGRAPH_LLM_CMD` | Default extractor and judge command (`claude -p`) |
| `MEMGRAPH_WRITER` | This machine's writer id for the effect log |
| `MEMGRAPH_TEST_SKIP_DATALEVIN=1` | Run the test suite pod-free |
| `MEMGRAPH_BENCH_STORE=memory` | Run benchmark mechanics pod-free |
